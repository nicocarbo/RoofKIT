The RoofKIT library was developed to do the simulations for the Team RoofKIT (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology) in the Solar Decathlon Europe 2021/2022 competition. 

The models have been developed and tested using openModelica 1.18, but can be run under other modelica-related environments (i.e. Dymola).

This package requires the following libraries;
- Modelica standard library 3.2.3
- Buildings 8.0.0
- AixLib 0.9.0
- BuildingSystems 2.0.0

Team RoofKIT wants to thank the developers of these libraries for facilitating models of different systems. The models were developed with educational purposes, for the decathletes to introduce themselves to advanced building simulation. The library has self-developed components, a database, and the models for the Design Challenge (GG) and House Demonstration Unit (HDU).
