This package contains the models in Modelica for the development of the energy concept in project RoofKIT (SDE21). 

The models have been developed and tested using openModelica 1.17, but can be run under other modelica-related environments (i.e. Dymola).

This package requires the following libraries;
- Modelica standard library 3.2.3
- Buildings 7.0.0
- AixLib 0.9.0
- BuildingSystems 1.7.0
